ArrayMath
=========

ArrayMath is a portable low level C++ library for performing primitive math
operations on arrays.

The idea is to provide a simple interface to highly optimized math kernels.


1. Usage
--------

Provided that you've built all the .cpp files into object files or a library
that you link to your project, here's some basic usage info:


1.1 Using the ArrayMath interface
---------------------------------

#include <ArrayMath.h>

void myFunction {
  // Initialize the ArrayMath object. Note: This object may contain state (for
  // instance for the random number generator), so it is *not* thread safe.
  arraymath::ArrayMath math;

  // Call array methods.
  float a[128], b[128];
  const unsigned len = sizeof(a) / sizeof(float);
  math.ramp(a, 0.0f, 100.0f, len);    // a = [0.0 .. 100.0]
  math.random(b, -1.0f, 1.0f, len);   // b = random, [-1.0, 1.0)
  math.madd(a, 0.5f, a, b, len);      // a = 0.5 * a + b
}
